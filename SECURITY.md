## Best Practices for Users

### Safe Installation

1. Download only from [official releases](https://github.com/stormix/deadlock-modmanager/releases/latest)
2. Scan downloads with antivirus software
3. Keep your system and the app updated

### Mod Safety

1. Install mods only from reputable GameBanana creators
2. Check reviews and ratings before installation
3. Backup game saves before installing new mods
4. Report suspicious mod behavior immediately

## Known Security Considerations

### Windows SmartScreen

New releases may trigger Windows SmartScreen warnings due to the code signing process. This is normal for new applications. Click "More info" → "Run anyway" after verifying the download source.

### Antivirus False Positives

Some antivirus software may flag the application due to file system access and network features. We work to minimize false positives.

### Mod Execution Risks

- Mods can execute code within the game environment
- Users are responsible for vetting mods before installation
- Mod conflicts can cause game instability
